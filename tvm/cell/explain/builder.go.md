# Builder

The provided Go code defines a package named `cell`, which seems to be a part of a larger project. This package is involved in constructing and manipulating binary data structures referred to as "cells." Below is a breakdown of the main components and their functionalities:

### 1. `Builder` Struct:

- **Purpose:**
  - Represents a builder for constructing binary cells.
  - Maintains state information during the construction process.

- **Fields:**
  - `bitsSz`: The total number of bits used.
  - `data`: The binary data being constructed.
  - `refs`: A slice of pointers to other `Cell` objects, used for referencing other cells.

- **Methods:**
  - `MustStore*` and `Store*` methods: Store various types of data (unsigned integers, big integers, strings, etc.) in the builder. If an error occurs, the `MustStore*` methods panic.
  - `StoreSlice`: Stores a slice of bytes in the builder.
  - `StoreBuilder`: Stores the contents of another builder in the current builder.
  - `StoreMaybeRef`: Stores a reference to another `Cell` or a null reference.
  - `StoreRef`: Stores a reference to another `Cell`.
  - `Copy`: Creates a copy of the current builder.
  - `BeginCell`: Initializes a new builder.

- **Helper Methods:**
  - Various methods prefixed with `MustStore*` are provided for convenience. If an error occurs during storage, these methods panic.

- **Information Retrieval Methods:**
  - `RefsUsed`: Returns the number of references used.
  - `BitsUsed`: Returns the total number of bits used.
  - `BitsLeft`: Returns the number of bits left.
  - `RefsLeft`: Returns the number of references left.

- **Construction Completion:**
  - `EndCell`: Finalizes the construction process and returns a new `Cell` object with the accumulated data.

### 2. `Cell` Struct:

- **Purpose:**
  - Represents a binary cell, a finalized structure constructed by the `Builder`.

- **Fields:**
  - `bitsSz`: The total number of bits used.
  - `data`: The binary data of the cell.
  - `refs`: A slice of pointers to other `Cell` objects.

- **Methods:**
  - None provided explicitly in the provided code. The `Cell` struct is mainly used for representing the final state of the constructed binary cell.

### 3. General Structure:

- The code uses a fluent interface, allowing method chaining for more concise construction of cells.
- The code ensures that the constructed binary data adheres to size constraints (e.g., not exceeding 1023 bits).
- Big integers are used for handling large numeric values.

### 4. Error Handling:

- The code uses the `MustStore*` methods to panic in case of errors during storage operations.
- Errors include cases where the size constraints are violated (`ErrTooBigValue`, `ErrTooBigSize`, etc.).

### 5. Usage Example:

Here is an example of how the `Builder` is used:

```go
// Create a new builder
builder := BeginCell()

// Store an unsigned integer (panic if an error occurs)
builder.MustStoreUInt(42, 8)

// Store a big integer (panic if an error occurs)
builder.MustStoreBigUInt(big.NewInt(123456789), 64)

// Finalize the construction and get the resulting cell
cell := builder.EndCell()
```

Overall, this package provides a flexible and modular way to construct binary cells with various types of data and references, enforcing constraints on size and handling errors in the process. The fluent interface makes the code more readable and expressive.

  - Purpose: Store the contents of another `Builder`.
  
##### Information Retrieval Methods:
- **`RefsUsed`, `BitsUsed`, `BitsLeft`, `RefsLeft`:**
  - Purpose: Retrieve information about the current state of the builder.

##### Construction Completion:
- **`EndCell`:**
  - Purpose: Finalizes the construction process and returns a new `Cell` object with the accumulated data.

##### Copying:
- **`Copy`:**
  - Purpose: Creates a copy of the current builder.

##### Initialization:
- **`BeginCell`:**
  - Purpose: Initializes a new builder.

#### Helper Methods:
- **`MustStore*` Methods:**
  - Purpose: Provided for convenience, they panic if an error occurs during storage.

#### Constraints:
- The code ensures that the constructed binary data adheres to size constraints (e.g., not exceeding 1023 bits).
- Errors include cases where the size constraints are violated (`ErrTooBigValue`, `ErrTooBigSize`, etc.).

### 2. `Cell` Struct:

#### Purpose:
The `Cell` struct represents a finalized binary cell. It holds the final state of the constructed binary structure.

#### Fields:
- **`bitsSz` (uint):**
  - Purpose: Represents the total number of bits used in the cell.
- **`data` ([]byte):**
  - Purpose: Stores the binary data of the cell.
- **`refs` ([]*Cell):**
  - Purpose: Maintains a slice of pointers to other `Cell` objects.

#### Methods:
- None provided explicitly in the provided code. The `Cell` struct is mainly used for representing the final state of the constructed binary cell.

- Big integers are used for handling large numeric values.

#### Usage Example:
Here is a more detailed usage example:

```go
// Create a new builder
builder := BeginCell()

// Store an unsigned integer
builder.MustStoreUInt(42, 8)

// Store a big integer
builder.MustStoreBigUInt(big.NewInt(123456789), 64)

// Finalize the construction and get the resulting cell
cell := builder.EndCell()

// Retrieve information about the constructed cell
bitsUsed := cell.BitsUsed()
refsUsed := cell.RefsUsed()
```

### Conclusion:

The `cell` package provides a flexible and modular way to construct binary cells with various types of data and references, enforcing constraints on size and handling errors in the process. The fluent interface makes the code more readable and expressive. The package seems designed to facilitate the construction of complex binary structures, perhaps for serialization or data storage purposes.
